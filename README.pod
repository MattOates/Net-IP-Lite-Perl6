=head2 Net::IP::Lite

This is a limited version of CPAN's Net::IP for Perl 6 and provides
a subset of its basic IPv4 and IPv6 address manipulation functions.

=head2 Functions Provided by Default

=over

Usage:

  use Net::IP::Lite;

=item ip-expand-address

Purpose           : Expand an address from compact notation
Params            : IP address
Returns           : expanded IP address or '' on failure

=item ip-reverse-address

Purpose           : Reverse an address from compact notation
Params            : IP address
Returns           : reversed IP address or '' on failure

=back

=head2 Functions Exported with Named Parameter C<:extra>

Usage:

  use Net::IP::Lite :extra;

=over

=item ip-get-version export(:extra)

Purpose           : Get an IP version
Params            : IP address
Returns           : 4, 6, 0 (don't know)

=item ip-is-ipv4 export(:extra)

Purpose           : Check if an IP address is version 4
Params            : IP address
Returns           : True or False

=item ip-is-ipv6 export(:extra)

Purpose           : Check if an IP address is version 6
Params            : IP address
Returns           : True or False

=head2 Limitations

Addresses may be entered in CIDR format and the network will be
considered.

For the moment, no consideration for plain addresses (those without
the network prefix and length) is made for invalidity other than the
format.

All "plain" addresses will be expanded to the 32-bit (IPv4) or 128-bit
(IPv6) format, but the network prefix will be respected in the
expansion of addresses in CIDR format.  Any CIDRs will be checked for
validity for the type of address.


=head2 Installation

Use one of the following two methods for a normal Perl 6 environment:

  zef install Net::IP::Lite
  panda install Net::IP::Lite

If either attempt shows that the module isn't found or available,
ensure your installer is current:

  zef update
  panda update

If you want to use the latest version in the git repository, clone it and then:

  cd /path/to/cloned/repository/directory
  zef install .

or

  panda install .

=head2 Development

It is the intent of this author to gradually add functions from the
parent module as needed, eventually approaching its full
functionality.  Interested users are encouraged to contribute
improvements and corrections to this module, and pull requests, bug
reports, and suggestions are always welcome.

While testing will be normally be done as part of the zef or panda
installation, cloning this project will result in a Makefile that can
be used in fine-tuning tests and yielding more verbose results during
the development process.  The Makefile can be tailored as desired.

=head2 Acknowledgements

This module is indebted to the CPAN Perl IP::Net module authors for
providing such a useful set of functions: Manuel Valente
