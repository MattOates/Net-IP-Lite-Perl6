=head2 Installation

Use one of the following two methods for a normal  Perl 6 environment:

  zef install Net::IP::Lite
  panda install Net::IP::Lite

If either attempt shows that the module isn't found or available,
ensure your installer is current:

  zef update
  panda update

If you want to use the latest version in the git repository, clone it and then:

  cd /path/to/cloned/repository/directory
  zef install .

or

  panda install .
