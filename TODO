REQUIREMENTS FOR INITIAL RELEASE
===========================================

mention md create utility

consider changing to check ip version inside other functions and not
  requiring ip-version in params; should change some subs to
  export(:util) as a result (NOT YET)

consider removing ip- prefix to subs

modify create md so user opts for fiddling with sig lines or not

modify create md so sig lines are collected and then folded (user has
  opted for such on the CLI)

be sure and report if sig lines are too long if user has opted out;

report results of sig folding
